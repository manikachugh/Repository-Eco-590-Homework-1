What I learnt in Github:-

1. How you can add your Resume's link on Github Readme.md 
2. You will need to add each file to Github.com to get the URL and then you can enter that in the format []().
3. Being new to this coding world,I looked for various not so useful things :joy: like 
  

What I am confused about :-
1. Does Github Desktop is same as Github.com? Because, I think there are many things that we can do on Github.com, that we cannot on Github desktop.
2. 

PS : I love Github :heart:. I wish I had known about this sooner. Eco 585's R class would have been much easier as it would allow me to follow coding in R and learn the language more efficiently. There are proper websites to learn about how to use Github and notes and notes to understand. I wish other languages were taught in the same way :disappointed:.
